# WIP: Dynamic Programming Applied to a Neo-Classical Growth Model

This project involves solving an optimal growth model using recursive methods, with an exploration of the case of a greedy policy. Additionally, it includes a resolution of the optimal policy using a neural network approach.

Model:

An agent allocates his time between producing the consumption good C and accumulating human capital H.
He seeks to maximize his discounted utility:
